# Proactive Complaint Management System with Agentic AI
## üìö About the Project
This project aims to develop an Agentic AI-powered decision support system to enhance the efficiency and transparency of proactive complaint management at the Faculty of Science and Technology, Kamphaeng Phet Rajabhat University.

The system will automate the process of analyzing complaints, suggesting responsible departments, and managing real-time status tracking. This will lead to a faster and more transparent resolution process, improving governance within the faculty.
### ‚ú® Key Features
